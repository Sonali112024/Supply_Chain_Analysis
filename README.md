**Supply Chain Analysis using Python**

This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup using Python. The analysis covers various stages of the supply chain, such as sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, and sales. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to improve supply chain effectiveness and create more value for customers.

**Project Overview**

Supply Chain Analysis involves examining the various components of a supply chain to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. In this project, we use a dataset containing information about a company's supply chain, such as product prices, availability, revenue, stock levels, transportation modes, and manufacturing costs.
We employ Python libraries like pandas and plotly to clean, analyze, and visualize the data for better insights into the company's supply chain operations.
