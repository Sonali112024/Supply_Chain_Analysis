Supply Chain Analysis using Python
This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup using Python. The analysis covers various stages of the supply chain, such as sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, and sales. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to improve supply chain effectiveness and create more value for customers.

Project Overview
Supply Chain Analysis involves examining the various components of a supply chain to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. In this project, we use a dataset containing information about a company's supply chain, such as product prices, availability, revenue, stock levels, transportation modes, and manufacturing costs.

We employ Python libraries like pandas and plotly to clean, analyze, and visualize the data for better insights into the company's supply chain operations.

Features
Data Exploration:

Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Generate descriptive statistics to understand key attributes such as price, availability, and revenue.
Data Visualization:

Scatter plots to analyze the relationship between product price and revenue by product type.
Pie charts to visualize sales distribution across different product types.
Bar charts to examine revenue generated by various shipping carriers.
Insights Derived:

Revenue trends by product type and price.
Contribution of each product category to overall sales.
Revenue generation by shipping carriers for operational optimization.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects for interactive data visualization.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains supply chain data for a Fashion and Beauty startup. It includes information on:

Product type, SKU, price, and availability.
Sales and revenue data.
Transportation modes, routes, and costs.
Manufacturing costs, defect rates, and production volumes.
Sample Data Columns:

Product type, Price, Number of products sold, Revenue generated, Stock levels, Transportation modes, Costs, and more.

Insights
Revenue Analysis: Skincare products contribute significantly to overall revenue.
Sales Distribution: Skincare products make up 45% of total sales, followed by haircare (29.5%) and cosmetics (25.5%).
Defect Rate by Product Type:
Haircare products have the highest defect rate among all product types, indicating a need for improved packaging or handling during shipping.
Defect Rate by Transportation Mode:
Road transportation results in the highest defect rate, highlighting potential issues such as rough handling or poor road conditions.
Air transportation has the lowest defect rate, making it a more reliable option for fragile or high-value products.
Shipping Carrier Optimization: Analysis of revenue by shipping carriers can help in cost and route optimization.
